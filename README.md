# The Mobile Salon
An online interface for salon business owners and customers.

> **Recommended to use Chrome**.

## Idea
The purpose of this project is for people to get their haircuts done without having to go to the salon and get their haircuts 
done risking catching COVID-19. The idea is that salon owners transform their business into a mobile truck that can satisfy 
a customer's needs by going to their house and reducing the chances of infection.

## How To Use
To experiment with the functions of the websites you must make a quick account with a user-name and password. All accounts will be taken down afterwards.

Below are the functions of this website *must make a account*:

1) As a customer you can head over to "Browse Shops" where you can view all the shop listings including yours. You will have the option to make a booking for every shop and possible delete a shop if it is yours.

2) Next being a business owner you can go to "Create a Shop" and fill in the form. You will be redirected to the main page with all the shops.

3) If you head over to "View Bookings" you will be provided with a list of bookings for all the shops you own.

> It is suggested that you create your own shop and make your own booking for it so that you can see the list of bookings.
